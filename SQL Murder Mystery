This is all of the SQL code which I used to figure out who the murderer was in SQL Murder Mystery (https://mystery.knightlab.com/#experienced).


/*
Use provided info to find the Crime Scene Report:

SELECT * 
FROM crime_scene_report
where city like "SQL City" and type like "murder" and date like 20180115;

Crime Scene Report:

Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. 
The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".
*/

/*
Find two people meeting criteria from Crime Scene Report in Person table:

SELECT * 
FROM person
where address_street_name like "%Northwestern Dr%" 
order by address_number desc;

id		name			license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
14887	Morty Schapiro	118009		4919			Northwestern Dr	111564949


SELECT * 
FROM person
where address_street_name like "%Franklin Ave%"
and name like "%Annabel%"

id		name			license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
16371	Annabel Miller	490173		103				Franklin Ave		318771143

*/

/*
Find the two interviews given by witnesses:

SELECT transcript 
FROM interview
JOIN person
ON person.id = interview.person_id
where person.id = 14887
or person.id = 16371

transcript
Morty Schapiro:
I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. 
The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
Only gold members have those bags. 
The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

Annabel Miller:
I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was 
working out last week on January the 9th.
*/

/*
Use witness statement info to find the gym members matching the criteria:
SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_member
where id like "48z%" and membership_status = "gold" 

id		person_id	name			membership_start_date	membership_status
48Z7A	28819		Joe Germuska	20160305				gold
48Z55	67318		Jeremy Bowers	20160101				gold
*/

/*
Check if either of the above members had checked in on January 9th, 2018
*/

/*
SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
where membership_id like "48Z7A" and check_in_date = 20180109
or membership_id like "48Z55" and check_in_date = 20180109

membership_id	check_in_date	check_in_time	check_out_time
48Z7A			20180109		1600			1730
48Z55			20180109		1530			1700

*/

/*Check if either of the two members have licence plate matching witness statement:

Select *
FROM person
JOIN drivers_license
ON person.license_id = drivers_license.id
WHERE plate_number like "%H42W%" and (person.id = 28819 or person.id = 67318)

id		name			license_id	address_number	address_street_name		ssn			id		age	height	eye_color	hair_color	gender	plate_number	car_make	car_model
67318	Jeremy Bowers	423327		530				Washington Pl, Apt 3A	871539279	423327	30	70		brown		brown		male	0H42W2			Chevrolet	Spark LS
*/

/*
Yay I found the murderer!

Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... 
If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript 
of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. 
If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, 
try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. 
Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.

SELECT transcript

I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. 
I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. 
I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

Time to break out the champagne!
